# Shiny App - Visualization of global influenza surveillance

This is a simple App to show the influenza surveillanec data worldwide. You can:

  - Select the country you want to check on the drop-down menu;
  - See case number of different types of influenza in the barplot (intereactive);
  - See the bubble map of the influenza incidence worldwide (non-interactive). 



The data was downloaded from the webside of [World Health Organization][df1], maintained by FluNet. It includes the global surveillance from the most recent week. Please see [here][df2] for the table of the source data.

Please note:

  - Some countries do not have reported the activity, thus you might see no bar in the graph.
